### ⚠️Warning⚠️
This calculator is intended solely for the purpose of verifying mathematical work and should not be used as a means to cheat or engage in academic dishonesty. It is designed to assist in understanding and confirming calculations, promoting a genuine learning experience. Any misuse of this tool for unethical purposes may have serious consequences. Use responsibly and in accordance with academic integrity principles.
## 📌About
This repository is meant to be a capable calculus calculator able to calculate derivatives and integrals. Its goal is to be able to evaluate derivatives with chain rule, quotient rule, and other derivative strategies. Additionally, it will be able to evaluate all integrals through U substitution or integrating by parts. Eventually, I would like to add steps to the solutions but for now only will return solutions.
### 💻Currently working on
Creating logic for a expression simplifier.
### 🎯Next Goal
Creating logic for product rule.
