# CalculusCalc
## About
This program is meant to be a capable calculus calculator able to calculate derivatives and integrals. Its goal is to be able to evaluate derivatives with chain rule, quotient rule, and other derivative strategies. Additionally, it will be able to evaluate all integrals through U substitution or integrating by parts. Eventually, I would like to add steps to the solutions but for now only will return solutions.
## Currently working on
Logic for evaluating derivtaives for polynomials.
## Next Goal
Creating logic for cahin rule.
